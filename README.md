Task 1 - I used a scanner to get the guess of the user. I then used a variable named attempts to track the amount of attempts the user took. From there I used a while loop and said while guess is not equal 
to the actual number, keep allowing the user to guess. If the guess is too low, it prints too low, and if the guess is too high, it prints too high. If there guess is correct, it prints out that it is the 
correct guess and tells the amount of attempts it took as well.

Task 2 - For the story generator, I used a string array to initialize all of the possible components in my story. Additionally, I used a scanner to get the character name. From there I printed out a story and
concatenated different elements of the story using randint and the value the user provided.

Task 3 - For the mini quiz app, I created 3 multiple choice questions and passes in the correct answers to the multiple choice questions. From there, I used a scanner to check if their value matched the correct value.
At the end, the app printed the score out.

Task 4 - For the drawing, I created a GUI application in Java. Here, I created a really cool pixelated dragon with a castle. I used JComponent and JFrame to do this.

Task 5 - For the countdown timer, I used a scanner to get the value from the user and time remaining. From there, I scheduled a timer and printed out the amount of seconds left after every second.
